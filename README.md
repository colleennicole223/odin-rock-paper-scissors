## My process

### Built with
- HTML
- CSS
  - Flex Containers 
- JavaScript 
  - Switch Statement
  - Event Listeners 
  - DOM manipulation


### What I learned

This project had me using DOM manipulation and Events for the first time. It was easier to understand the format once I had a better grasp on arrow functions. I attached event listeners to the rock, paper, and scissor button nodes to read the users selection. I enjoyed being able to directly target nodes with selectors and change their properties - this allowed me to change button colors based on human or computer selection.  

### Continued development

Need more practice with event listeners, with more experience I think I would have set this project up differently and could have added some more user-friendly features.
